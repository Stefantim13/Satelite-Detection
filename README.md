🛰️ Satellite Object Detection with YOLOv8-OBB

This project focuses on detecting objects in satellite images using a custom-trained YOLOv11n model with Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB). The model has been fine-tuned on satellite imagery data and is capable of predicting both the location and orientation of detected objects.
